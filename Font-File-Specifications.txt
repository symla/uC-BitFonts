Font has to shipped as (multiple) PNG-file(s).

Limitations:
    - minimum char height: 5 pixels (limited by offset & preserve layer information)
    - maximum offset amount: equals char width

Naming convention: a-zA-Z0-9_

Main PNG: contains the bitmap
Offset & Preserve PNG: contains offsets
Config PNG: settings (width, height, spacing)



# Main PNG:
            - file name: Font_Example_123.png
            - png with 256 tiles, each of same width and height, 16 by 16 tiles
            - the first character (NULL) is used for unknown chars

# Offset & Preserve PNG:
            - file name: Font_Example_123_OffsetPreserve.png
            - same dimensions as main png (to edit the offset png as additional
              layer in graphics editor). Within a tile the first four rows
              are used to set the tile-wise offset:
                1. row: preserve bit: first pixel of the row = black
                        -> char is empty, do not show unknown char
                2. row: top -> how many pixels to move to top direction
                3. row: left -> same with left
                4. row: bottom -> same with bottom
                5. row: right -> same with right
            --> this limits the minimum char height to 4 pixels!

# Config PNG:
            - file name: Font_Example_123_Config.png
            - 16x16 pixel image
                --> 32 bytes for configuration
                - bytes are read as follows:
                    - first row, pixels 0-7 = 1. byte
                    - first row, pixels 8-15 = 2. byte
                    - second row, pixels 16-23 = 3. byte
                    - ...
            - things to configure
                1. byte: char width in pixels
                2. byte: char height in pixels
